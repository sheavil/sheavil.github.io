Notes I am thinking about as I work on this:
-I don't know how the display max row thing you did with panda dataframe is going to show up in the GitHub page. All the example pages did data.head() so I changed the code to do data.head() so it wouldn't like show up as 200 rows on the GitHub page. But if it appears as a scrollable on the GitHub page same as in Jupyter notebook then maybe we should just keep the whole table.
